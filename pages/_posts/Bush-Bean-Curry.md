A couple redesigns ago (preferred time unit here), I stated that I wanted to use this blog to talk about a variety of topics and hobbies I'm interested in. Truthfully, I never touched anything besides programming or tech-related stuff. That all changes today with the introduction of yet another series with probably this being the only ever episode. Hot Sauce will cover some of my favorite dishes and their recipes.

### Ingredients

For this recipe, you will need:

- bush beans
- bamboo shoots (glass)
- carrots
- onions
- ginger
- curcuma
- coconut milk
- soy sauce

### Preparation

Wash the bush beans, bamboo shoots and carrots. The bamboo shoots can have a smell that might be unappealing to some, so give them a specially good rinse in the sink to remove it. Remove the ends from the bush beans and carrots, then peel and slice the carrots and cut the bush beans into halves or thirds, depending on their size. Peel and chop the onion.

### Recipe

Roast the onions gently with some oil. Afterwards, add the carrots and bamboo shots until they have a slightly soft consistency. Lastly, slightly roast the bush beans under medium to high heat.

Deglaze the ingredients with a bit of soy sauce, then under low heat add the coconut milk. Add some flavor with curcuma, grated ginger, salt and if you want chili flakes. Serve with a side dish of your choosing - rice or bread goes well with it.

There you have it! Easy, fast and the sauce is just awesome.
